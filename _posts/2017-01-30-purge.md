title: Purge cache after Jekyll build using Cloudflare API and TravisCI
summary:
    Purging Cache using Cloudflare after building Jekyll saves me from
    purging everything, and not buy the tag feature

I use [Cloudflare's CDN](https://www.cloudflare.com/cdn/) for this site, as it's very easy to setup and also has a free plan, which is just
right for my usage, as I want to deliver this site as fast as possible to the users, and it reduces my
actual bandwidth usage on [Firebase](https://firebase.com) which is quite limited on the Free Tier **(10 GB/Month)**

<!--Information about my Usecase and how I wanted to solve the problem -->
A usecase occured where I was publishing major changes to my jekyll blog very frequently, Cloudflare's CDN
wasn't getting revalidated each time, I did a `jekyll build` using `TravisCI` which was leading to inconsidtent
user experience as the content previously cached on the CDN wasn't getting invalidated.

## Cloudflare's Purging Options

Luckily Cloudflare offers, nice options to purge the content from the CDN. Cloudflare offers
[various options](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200169246-How-do-I-purge-my-cache-)
 in order to purge the cache.

On a free plan, I could've either purged the entire cache, or purge individual files by url.

Purging entire cache was never an option, as I not only use this domain for my Blog, but also for Github Pages, Portfolio, and some other random things, I don't even remember about right now.

After considering the two options, I went for Purging by Individual files, however, doing it all through the UI, every single time, would
be quite hard for me to do.

## Cloudflare API and Node.js Client

[Cloudflare API](https://api.cloudflare.com/)
exposes the entire interface of Cloudflare, including Purging. In order to purge files individually, we 
can pass it an array of file URLs *(upto 30 in a request)*.

Cloudflare also has an easy to use [node.js client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cloudflare), which I used to do something cool,
we are going to talk about next.

## Writing a script to purge using Cloudfare's Node.js client

Afterwards, I just wrote a simple script that parsed the URLs present in the `sitemap.xml` of build folder
`(_site)` using node library `xml2js`. Cloudflare had a limit of upto 30 URLs that can be purged in one request *(which might be there to protect from misuse)* , in order to solve this problem, we returned multiple promisified calls to `Zone.deleteCache` of URLs chunked into array at max 30 urls and resolved them all using `Promise.all` function.

You can take a look at the scripts I wrote for purging by going to [scripts/purger](https://github.com/abdulhannanali/fascinations-of-hannan/tree/master/scripts/purger) directory in this blog's repository. [purger/index.js](https://github.com/abdulhannanali/fascinations-of-hannan/blob/master/scripts/purger/index.js) is the main file initiated to purge the URLs from Cloudflare.

### Automating script purging task using [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org)

Doing a build and deploying it to two environments production and staging, none of these tasks are handled by me, but by [**Travis the builder**](https://travis-ci.org). This is quite a mundane task, and will save hours in the long run if properly automated.

After the deploy is succeeded to the `master` branch successfully, `scripts/purger/index.js` is initiated using this simple command

```bash
node --harmony_async_await scripts/purger/index.js
```

> *Note: `--harmony_async_await` flag is only there as `async/await` is not a stable feature in Node.js as of `v7.4.0`, refrain from using it in server side production code, right now*

This purge task needs to be run only in `master`, as I don't have Cloudflare CDN set up for the domains running in staging environment, such as "surge.sh", and "Github Pages", so we run this command after the deploy to firebase succeeds within the `"TRAVIS_BRANCH" == "master"` condition in `deploy.sh`.

#### Power of TravisCI and Cloudflare

Here's to show the power of what you can achieve using Cloudflare's Powerful API and the customization Travis CI provides you in your 
build environment. 

I hope you learned about extent to which you can customize and control your Jekyll build environment, through tools such as [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org) and also discover how easy
it is to use Cloudflare's API to do tasks, that might take a lot of time otherwise, if done manually from the Cloudflare's UI. :heart:
