## Coding gives us wings 

Programming holds the power to revoutionize our lives and the way we think, interact and make. It not only
holds intrinsic but is a highly rewarding skills, as you get to write and determine how the current
and future world works. 

With automation coming in place, there are not going to be as many manual labor jobs, jobs which many people
have relied on for maybe centuries, but majority of the world isn't ready for this upcoming time. 
As a human, it's my responsibility to enable more people to learn these skills, so they can improve and
impact the lives of others in a better way.

### Initiatives and the communication gap

Despite having all amazing global initatives such as [Code.org](https://code.org), 
[KhanAcademy](https://khanacademy.org)
, and countless others websites offering quality education on CS topics such as [Udacity](https://udacity.com) there 
is still a big gap that's not being covered, people here are not getting oriented into that CS Learning mindset.

There's definitely lack of resources, people are still struggling in developing countries, to fulfill their
basic needs, but there's a lack of awareness here too, for people with resources.

The reason behind this mainly comes to our treatment of Computer Science Education locally, and even though
initiatives are being started by various groups and some cool indviduals in Pakistan, we
still need to come together and rethink how much we emphasize the role of technology in our daily lives
and do more effort to give this superpower to more people.

### Activities at the local level

Improving the state of CS education, requires us to increase our activities at the local level, wherever
we are cos, this still might be the best way to reach people who otherwise won't ever think of this, even
though value of CS Education and Skills is going to be very **apparent** in the future. 

If you're a high schooler start a **[Hack Club](https://hackclub.com)** in your high school, 
HackClub allows the students to participate
in practical CS learning and project making which is a great activity on it's own, or to start
with, you can organize an **[Hour of Code](https://code.org/learn)**. These initiatives not only are a nice 
community activity, but can also be a way to empower people with resources who can't afford them.

The number of organizations supporting such initiatives doesn't end here, you can

### Encouraging Women to code

Women can play a big role in the future advances in the technology sector, and we should make our efforts,
keeping this in mind, encouraging them at every level, programs catered especially towards women can play
a huge role, the state of women in tech and who code in Pakistan, is not quite good as of now, as there a lot of problems that women face in Pakistan, which owe a separate post of it's own, this can definitely be improved
if we focus on the number of women we are reaching out to and increase the effort if it's low. Programs 
such as [SheSkills](https://schoolofskills.co/sheskills/) even though not all coding, are highly encouraging,
and I would also like to get involved in one such effort in the future.
