## Power we have 

Programming holds the power to revoutionize daily lives, everywhere in the world, it has the 
ability to revolutionize our daily lives, and the way we think, interact and make. It not only
holds intrinsic but is a highly rewarding skills, as you get to write and determine how the current
and future world works. 

With automation coming in place, there are not going to be as many manual labor jobs, jobs which many people
rely on, but majority of the world isn't ready for this generation. 
As a human, it's my responsibility to enable more people to learn these skills, so they can improve and
impact the lives of others in a better way.

### Still a lot to do

However, we still don't see many people learning to code or learn CS related concepts in their daily lives,
there aren't many initiatives spreading awareness about the importance of CS skills in general and especially
to women population. There's an incredible potential I see there, that needs to be harnessed, and if someone
hasn't started playing their role, simply **NOW** is the time.

### How I got into coding

My story, is not here, because I wan't to brag about something, but it's very much the part of what I am
trying to do with this initiative.
