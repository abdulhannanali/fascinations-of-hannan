<!--Write about content here-->
Hey There, Hannan here, I made this blog,to write about stuff I am excited about, I am angry about and also about the things I want a change about. This blog is going to be my very first way, I made this blog to open up about ideas I have and discuss issues that need to be addressed.

For me, it's not just about writing good content, but influencing people to be the change and improve their lives. I don't know everything, but whatever I know, through this blog, I will be able to tell you about that too.
