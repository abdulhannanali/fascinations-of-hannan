<!--Write about content here-->
Hey There, Hannan here, I made this blog,to write about stuff I am excited about, I am angry about and also about the things I want a change about. This blog is going be a way to open up about ideas I have and discuss issues that need to be addressed.

For me, it's not just about writing good content, but influencing people to be the change, and improve their lives. I don't know everything, but whatever I know, through this blog, I will be able to help you with that.

I like having a personal blog and, in an ideal world, I would have to write only here, but that's not the case always, so I also write on **[Medium](https://medium.com/@abdulhannanali)** too to reach more people. I have future plans to start a Youtube channel, but that's something in the far future, as I am working on a lot of things at a time right now.

You can check out my Personal Portfolio at [hannanali.tech](https://hannanali.tech).

Say Hi to me on Twitter [@computistic](https://twitter.com/computistic) (just sayin'), stalk me on [Facebook](https://facebook.com/abdulhannanali) and to keep updated with things I am doing regarding software, you can checkout my [Github portfolio](https://github.com/abdulhannanali). 

Here's my email by the way [hi@hannanali.tech](mailto:hi@hannanali.tech)
